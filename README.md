# Uber-Rides-Data-Analysis-using-Python

This project aims to analyze Uber ride data to uncover trends in ride demand, pricing, and customer behavior. Using Python, various data analysis techniques were applied to gain insights into ride patterns, peak hours, and geographic trends.

Pandas:  This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.

Numpy: Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.

Matplotlib / Seaborn: This library is used to draw visualizations.
